        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>When Soma faced off against Eizan, known as "The Alchemist" for his ability to steer his cooking in the
            direction that negates the flavor of his opponents, he didn't seem fazed one bit.  Even when the judges had
            a bias towards "gourmet food", he just cooked his food and proved that gourmet can be unique.</p>
