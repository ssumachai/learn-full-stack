        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Of all the different dishes that have been featured in <em>Food Wars!</em>, the Sumire Karaage Roll may just
            be the most salivating one.  This was the dish that combined efforts from all of the local stores in the
            area of Yukihira Diner when they were faced with the challenge of a huge chain opening up and monopolizing
            sales.  It was crafted with consideration to the people who frequent the area, resulting in a wrap taht could
            easily be eaten fresh and on the go.  In a world that's pretty fast-paced and never stopping, this would be
            a great option that's both convenient and delicious.</p>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut chicken thights, onion, and apple into bite-sized pieces, do not peel the apple</li>
                <li>Put the Apple and Onion from Step 1 into a food processor and add (<b>Set A</b>) and Puree.</li>
                <li>Put Step 2 into a plastic bag and add the chicken from Step 1.  Rub the meat well with Step 2 and
                    then let sit in the refridgerator overnight to marinate.
                </li>
                <li>Heat frying oil to 350Â°F.  Lightly coat Step 3 with potato starch and deep-fry for 5 minutes, or
                    until golden brown.  While frying, use a skimmer to scoop the meat out of the oil briefly one or two
                    times to air.
                </li>
                <li>Make the Banh Xeo batter.  Put (<b>Set B</b>) in a bowl and mix.  Slowly add coconut milk, water
                and beat into a batter with a mixer.
                </li>
                <li>Heat the cooking oil in a frying pan then add 1/4 of Step 5.  Quickly spread it thinly across the pan
                    and cook on low heat.  Once the edges start turning up, add one teaspoon of sesame oil all the way around 
                    the edges and cook until crispy.  Quickly flip with a spatula, briefly cook the other side, and then move to 
                    a plate.  Cook the remaining three portions of the batter the same way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the cilantro, green perilla leaves, and lettuce leaves onto Step 6 and add the fried chicken from Step 4.
                    Quickly mix together the hot sauce from (<b>Set C</b>) and pour over the chicken, top with black pepper, and done!
